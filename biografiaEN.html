        <br>
        I've been working since I was 18 years old. I started working for American Airlines as an International Security Agent. After being working for about a year and a half I started my studies at college. Due to my work schedules I couldn't be able to do both things at the same time so I decided to look for another job. After a couple months I started working at Delta Air Lines as a baggage agent. So I was able to work and study at the same. I've been working for Delta Air Lines 5 years total. Little by little I was obtaining a lot experience and I could be able to have other positions at the company until the last one where I ended up being Conflict Manager Resolutionist.</p>

        <br>
        Unfortunately, for different reasons against my will. I decided to move to Madrid-Spain. Once I got to Madrid I started subtitling tv shows at Netflix. Once I ended up those projects and so I liked so much the tourism industry I started working as a Recepcionist at Ok Hostel. After a couple years I could be able to get the Front Desk management position which I had for a year and a half.

        With the time, I decided to change to a better Hotel category and I started working as a Recepcionist at Hotel RIU Plaza de Espa√±a. I lasted a year on this job and I started studying web development at The Bridge Digital acelerator Academy. At this moment I am having so much good expectations about the wonderful things this short-term project is going to bring me in the future. </p>

        <h2>What can I offer to your company?</h2>
        <br>
        <p class="imtext">Without doubts in the workplace world there exist two different kind of people when they are facing a problem. The ones that focus on the issue and, the other ones that focus on the solution. I cannot only give the best solutions to your company but also I will give every part of me in order to reach all the goals with success at the proper time and efficiency that characterizes me. Nevertheless, I will give the best of my energies and I will look after for the wellness and happiness for those around me.</p>

        <p class="imtext">Right know I am doing a web and application development program. I could say I am opening myself to the technology world. So far, in a short-term project I see myself finishing up the program and, in a middle-term project I see myself working as a web developer in a enterprise that gives me the opportunity to debut with the best of my energies and to apply all the skills and knowledge that I have learned during my professional live.</p>
